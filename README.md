# Innovation Fair 2021

This is the official landing page for Innovation Fair 2021 hosted by University of Toronto Application Development Association.

## Quick-start

```bash
cd /path/to/your/directory
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/UT-Applicataion-Development-Association/Innovation-Fair-2021.git
cd Innovation-Fair-2021
git checkout dev
# Install React and npm packages
npm install
# Run the program
npm start
```

## Contribution Guideline

### VSCode and Branches

Visual Studio Code is the recommended text editor.

You may install the following plugins:

- ESlint (code linter)
- Live Sass Compiler (compile Sass to CSS)
- Prettier (code formatter)

Commitments should be made in individual branches. After branch features are done, make a pull request of merging into `dev` branch.

```bash
# Create a branch
git branch my-branch
# Checkout to the branch
git checkout my-branch
```

### Sass

All styles should be declared in `/src/styles` in `.scss` files. [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) files need to be compiled using Live Sass Compiler plugin, click the **Watch Sass** button at the bottom-right corner of VSCode. The styling of each component should be its individual sass file with the name `_Component.scss`, which should be imported in `Style.scss` using `@import "./components/<Component>";`

#### Tips

1. Please make use of the global_vars. Add `@import "../global_vars";` to your component scss file.
2. Please use specialized names or use nested styling to avoid class conflicts.

## Getting Started with Create React App

**The following content is generated by Create-React-App.**

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More
